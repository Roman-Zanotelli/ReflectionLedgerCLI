# 📘 ReflectionLedgerCLI (Archived)

**ReflectionLedgerCLI** is a lightweight, Java-based accounting ledger application that demonstrates advanced **reflection** and **annotation-driven command-line management**.

This Project was created in 5-7 days with no prior knowledge/planning, The main object was to create a ledger CLI from a list of requirements (all of which were completed) but was eventually extended into a reflection CLI system for fun. This implementation while simple reflects how many industry standard libraries operate such as Spring (without a dependency graph)

## ✨ Project Highlights

- ✅ **CLI Management via Java Annotations**
- 🧠 **Dynamic Method Invocation via Reflection**
- 📁 **File-backed ledger storage**
- 🐳 **Dockerized for portability**

This project was built as an educational exploration of Java’s runtime capabilities, especially around reflection and annotation parsing.
